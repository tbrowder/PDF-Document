COLOR
=====

Need to handle color generally, particularly for geometric
  objects 

Maybe a color class with r,g,b attrs:
  if only r is defined it's a gray value, but r,g,b defined is color
  that should work for rgb color (could add cmyk)

Make all geom objects classes with color role

Need to have a private introspection method to determine
what existing color state is so the methods that depend
on color masking (e,g., moon-phase) work properly.

MOON CRESCENT ANGLE
===================

Caclulate the Moon crescent angle using formulas in the book "Celestial Calculations"
on p. 89 (converting equatorial coordinates to the horizon coordinate system).
