The MICR Encoding font for bank checks was optained from 1001fonts.com:
  https://www.1001fonts.com/micr-encoding-font.html

The downloaded file was named 'micr-encoding.zip' (which was deleted
after unzipping it).

When file 'micr-encoding.zip' was unzipped into the 'unzipped'
directory, the following files were found:

  '!DigitalGraphicLabs.html'
  '!license.txt'
  micrenc.ttf

The two files in single quotes were renamed to:

  DigitalGraphicLabs.html
  license.txt

The license basically says the font is free to use for non-commercial purposes.

The font was transformed to an Adobe PostScript Type 1 font by creating
'.pfa' and '.afm' files using program 'fontforge'. See the accompanying
file 'README.fontforge' for the procedues used.
